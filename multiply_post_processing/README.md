# FuncDivMetrix

Script to calculate Functional Diversity from multiple plant trait raster files (ascii/tiff). Functional Diversity metrics are calculated over plots of adjecent pixels considering the N-dimensional combination of traits found in these pixels. The functional diversity metrics included are: 1) Functional Richnness - Measured through Convex Hull (CVH) Calculation encompassing the volume of trait space observed, 2/3) Funtional divergence - Measured by Mean Nearest Neighbour Distance (MNND) and Villeger's Centroid-based Divergenc (FDiv) and 4) Functional Evenness as formulated by Villeger et al. (2008), (FE).
